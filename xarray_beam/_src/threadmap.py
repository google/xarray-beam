"""Beam Map transforms that execute in parallel using a thread pool.

This can be a good idea for IO bound tasks, but generally should be avoided for
CPU bound tasks, especially CPU bound tasks that do not release the Python GIL.

They can be used as drop-in substitutes for the corresponding Beam transforms:
- beam.Map -> ThreadMap
- beam.MapTuple -> ThreadMapTuple
- beam.FlatMap -> FlatThreadMap
- beam.FlatMapTuple -> FlatThreadMapTuple

By default, 16 threads are used per task. This can be adjusted via the
`num_threads` keyword argument.
